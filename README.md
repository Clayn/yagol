# Yet Another Game Of Life [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Clayn/yagol.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/Clayn/yagol)
Yagol is another implementation of [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) written in Java. 
The project is separated into two Maven Modules:

 - Yagol-Core
 - Yagol-FX
 
The core project is used to provide the functionality and basic classes so that you could create your own UI or use it for other purposes. 
The FX project is a sampel UI to display the Game of Life using JavaFX.

## Usage
Yagol is really easy to use. So lets see what we need to create a new Game of Life 
and use it:

    Field field=new Field();
